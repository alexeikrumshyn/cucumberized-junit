# Cucumberized JUnit
A fourth year honours project for COMP 4905 at Carleton University. The purpose of this project is to provide guidance for industry developers that want to apply BDD (behaviour-driven development) principles using JUnit. The current (but not widely used) BDD framework is Cucumber, from which inspiration will be taken, hence the name "Cucumberized" JUnit.

This is a work in progress - more instructions to be added later.
